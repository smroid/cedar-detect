//! CedarDetect provides efficient and accurate detection of stars in sky images.
//! Given an image, CedarDetect returns a list of detected star centroids expressed
//! in image pixel coordinates. The input image should be the camera's native full
//! resolution; centroid coordinates are always in the pixel space of whichever
//! image is supplied.
//!
//! Features:
//!
//! * Employs localized thresholding to tolerate changes in background levels
//!   across the image.
//! * Adapts to different image exposure levels.
//! * Estimates noise in the image and adapts the star detection threshold
//!   accordingly.
//! * Optionally classifies and rejects isolated hot pixels.
//! * Rejects trailed objects such as aircraft lights or satellites.
//! * Tolerates the presence of bright interlopers such as the moon or
//!   streetlights.
//! * Simple function call interface with few parameters aside from the input
//!   image.
//! * Fast! On a Raspberry Pi 4B, the execution time per 1M image pixels is
//!   usually less than 10ms, even when several dozen stars are present in the
//!   image.
//!
//! # Intended applications
//!
//! CedarDetect is designed to be used with astrometry and plate solving systems
//! such as [Cedar-Solve](https://github.com/smroid/cedar-solve). It can also be
//! incorporated into satellite star trackers.
//!
//! A goal of CedarDetect is to allow such applications to achieve fast response
//! times. CedarDetect contributes to this by running quickly and by tolerating a
//! degree of image noise allowing for shorter imaging integration times.
//!
//! # Star detection fidelity
//!
//! Like any detection algorithm, CedarDetect produces both false negatives (failures
//! to detect actual stars) and false positives (spurious star detections). The
//! Caveats section below mentions some causes of false negatives.
//!
//! False positives can occur as you reduce the `sigma` parameter when calling
//! [get_stars_from_image()] in an attempt to increase the number of detected
//! stars. Although CedarDetect requires evidence from multiple pixels to qualify
//! each star detection (reducing the occurrence of false positives), noise
//! inevitably wins if you push `sigma` too low.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! CedarDetect spends most of its time on a single efficient pass over the input
//! image. This generates a set of star candidates that are subjected to further
//! scrutiny. The candidates number in the hundreds or perhaps thousands (thus
//! much less than the number of image pixels), so the candidate evaluation
//! usually takes only a fraction of the overall time.
//!
//! The code comments have much more detail.
//!
//! # Caveats
//!
//! ## Star extraction only
//!
//! CedarDetect is designed to identify only star-like spots. It is not a
//! generalized astronomical source extraction system.
//!
//! ## Crowding
//!
//! The criteria used by CedarDetect to efficiently detect stars are designed
//! around the characteristics of a star image's pixels compared to surrounding
//! pixels. CedarDetect can thus be confused when stars are too closely spaced,
//! or a star is close to a hot pixel, or if image shake causes star images to
//! be "doubled". Such situations will usually cause closely spaced stars to
//! fail to be detected. Note that for applications such as plate solving, this
//! is probably for the better.
//!
//! ## Imaging requirements
//!
//! * CedarDetect supports only 8-bit grayscale images; color images or images with
//!   greater bit depth must be converted before calling
//!   [get_stars_from_image()].
//! * The imaging exposure time and sensor gain are usually chosen by the caller
//!   to yield a desired number of faint star detections. In so doing, if a
//!   bright star is overexposed to a degree that it bleeds into too many
//!   adjacent pixels, CedarDetect will reject the bright star.
//! * Pixel scale and focusing are crucial:
//!   * If star images are too extended w.r.t. the pixel grid, CedarDetect might not
//!     detect the stars. You'll either need to tighten the focus or use the pixel
//!     binning option when calling [get_stars_from_image()].
//!   * If stars are too small w.r.t. the pixel grid, CedarDetect might
//!     mis-classify stars as isolated hot pixels. A simple remedy is to
//!     slightly defocus causing stars to occupy a central peak pixel with a bit
//!     of spread into immediately adjacent pixels.
//! * CedarDetect does not tolerate more than maybe a single pixel of motion blur.
//!
//! ## Centroid estimation
//!
//! CedarDetect computes a sub-pixel centroid position for each detected star
//! as the flux-weighted center of gravity of the star's pixels. This suffices
//! for many purposes, but a more exacting application might want to do its own
//! centroiding:
//!
//! * If a higher bit-depth image was converted to 8 bit for calling
//!   [get_stars_from_image()], centroiding in the original image may yield
//!   better accuracy.
//! * The application can use a more artful centroiding technique such as
//!   gaussian fitting.
//!
//! ## Lens distortions
//!
//! Optical imaging systems can produce distortions that affect CedarDetect in two
//! ways:
//!
//! * Optical aberrations can cause star images to deviate from ideal small
//!   condensed spots. CedarDetect will fail to detect stars that are too distorted,
//!   such as near the corners of a wide field image.
//! * Lens pincushion and/or barrel distortions can cause reported star positions
//!   to deviate from their true positions. CedarDetect reports star centroids in
//!   the image's x/y coordinates; it is up to the application to apply any needed
//!   lens distortion corrections when doing astrometry (e.g. plate solving).

//
// A Blob is one or more candidates from gate_star_1d(), grouped together
// by form_blobs_from_candidates(). We define the following terms:
//
// Core: this is the bounding box that includes all of the input Blob's pixel
//   coordinates. In most cases the core consists of a single pixel, but for
//   brighter stars it can span multiple rows/columns. Confusing non-star
//   regions of the image (such as the lunar terminator) can also yield
//   multi-pixel cores.
// Neighbors: the single pixel box surrounding the core.
// Margin: the single pixel box surrounding neighbors.
// Perimeter: the single pixel box surrounding margin.
//
// When the core contains a star, we will observe/require the following:
//
// * Core is not too large.
// * Core is brightest.
// * The perimeter pixels are taken to reflect the local sky background value.
// * The core is brighter than the sky background by a statistically significant
//   amount.
//
// If a Blob and its surroundings satisfies these (and other; see the code)
// criteria, a StarDescription is generated by performing centroiding on the
// core+neighbor pixels. If any of these criteria are not met, the Blob
// is deemed to be NOT a star.
//
// Note that the "margin" box isn't mentioned in the above narration. The margin
// box allows some additional star defocus by pushing the sky background pixels
// (perimeter box) out a bit.
//
// Statistical significance is defined as a `sigma` multiple of the
// `noise_estimate`.
//
// image: This is either the original full resolution image, or a 2x2, 4x4, or
//     8x8 binned image.
//
// higher_res_image: if binning == 1, this is the same as 'image'. For other
//     binning values, this is the one-less binned image preceding 'image' in
//     the binning cascade. For example, if binning==4, image is 4x binned and
//     higher_res_image is only 2x binned.
//
// Regardless of whether `image` is the original or a 2x, 4x, or 8x binning,
//     we arrange to do centroiding on the higher resolution image.
//
// binning: 1 (no binning), 2, 4, or 8.
//
// noise_estimate: the noise level of `image`.
//
// higher_res_noise_estimate: the noise level of `higher_res_image`.
