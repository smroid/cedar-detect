# Overview

CedarDetect provides efficient and accurate detection of stars in sky images.
Given an image, CedarDetect returns a list of detected star centroids expressed
in image pixel coordinates.

Features:

* Employs localized thresholding to tolerate changes in background levels
  across the image.
* Adapts to different image exposure levels.
* Estimates noise in the image and adapts the star detection threshold
  accordingly.
* Automatically classifies and rejects hot pixels.
* Rejects trailed objects such as aircraft lights or satellites.
* Tolerates the presence of bright interlopers such as the moon, streetlights,
  or illuminated foreground objects.
* Simple function call interface with few parameters aside from the input
  image.
* Fast! On a Raspberry Pi 4B, the execution time per 1M image pixels is
  usually less than 10ms, even when several dozen stars are present in the
  image.

For more information, see the crate documentation in src/algorithm.rs.

# Usage

## Rust

See the sample program at src/bin/test_cedar_detect.rs for example usages of
CedarDetect called directly from Rust program logic.

### Building on Mac

Installing the protobuf prerequisite:

```shell
brew install protobuf
```

## Python

There is (currently) no option to link CedarDetect with Python. Instead, a
microservice invocation API is provided using gRPC.

The src/bin/cedar_detect_server.rs binary runs as a gRPC service, providing a simple
image &rarr; centroids RPC interface. See src/proto/cedar_detect.proto for the gRPC
service definition.

In python/cedar_detect_client.py, a simple Python script demonstrates how to invoke
CedarDetect using its gRPC server. This program reads some test images, uses
CedarDetect to find centroids, and then plate-solves these centroids using Tetra3.

To try it out:

0. Install Python and all needed dependencies.
1. Install Tetra3.
2. With python/ as your current directory, execute:

        python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I../src/proto --python_out=. --pyi_out=. --grpc_python_out=. ../src/proto/cedar_detect.proto
3. Run the CedarDetect gRPC server in background:

        cargo run --release --bin cedar-detect-server &
4. Run the python program:

        python cedar_detect_client.py
## Other languages

Any language that can be a gRPC client should be able to invoke CedarDetect.
